Dear colleagues and senior brothers, 
please first read the readme. When you start using the code repository, please pay attention to the details such as whether roscore is enabled. 
For the camera and radar workspaces, 
please directly clone them. 
I made modifications to the driver to better handle and read the data. 
If you directly use the official ROS driver, you will encounter problems with failed device connection.
